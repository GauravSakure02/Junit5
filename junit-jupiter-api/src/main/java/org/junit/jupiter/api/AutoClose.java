/**
 * {@code @AutoClose} is used to indicate that an annotated field will be
 * automatically closed after test execution.
 *
 * <p>{@code @AutoClose} fields may be either {@code static} or non-static. If
 * the value of an {@code @AutoClose} field is {@code null} when it is evaluated
 * the field will be ignored, but a warning message will be logged to inform you.
 *
 * <p>By default, {@code @AutoClose} expects the value of the annotated field to
 * implement a {@code close()} method that will be invoked to close the resource.
 * However, developers can customize the name of the {@code close} method via the
 * {@link #value} attribute. For example, {@code @AutoClose("shutdown")} instructs
 * JUnit to look for a {@code shutdown()} method to close the resource.
 *
 * <p>{@code @AutoClose} may be used as a meta-annotation in order to create a
 * custom <em>composed annotation</em> that inherits the semantics of
 * {@code @AutoClose}.
 *
 * <h2>Inheritance</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code @AutoClose} fields are inherited from superclasses as long as they
 * are not <em>hidden</em>. Furthermore, {@code @AutoClose} fields from subclasses
 * will be closed before {@code @AutoClose} fields in superclasses.
 *
 * <h2>Evaluation Order</h2>
 *
 * <p>When multiple {@code @AutoClose} fields exist within a given test class,
 * the order in which the resources are closed depends on an algorithm that is
 * deterministic but intentionally nonobvious. This ensures that subsequent runs
 * of a test suite close resources in the same order, thereby allowing for
 * repeatable builds.
 *
 * <h2>Scope and Lifecycle</h2>
 *
 * <p>The extension that closes {@code @AutoClose} fields implements the
 * {@link org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.AfterAllCallback AfterAllCallback} and
 * {@link org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.TestInstancePreDestroyCallback
 * TestInstancePreDestroyCallback} extension APIs. Consequently, a {@code static}
 * {@code @AutoClose} field will be closed after all tests in the current test
 * class have completed, effectively after {@code @AfterAll} methods have executed
 * for the test class. A non-static {@code @AutoClose} field will be closed before
 * the current test class instance is destroyed. Specifically, if the test class
 * is configured with
 * {@link TestInstance.Lifecycle#PER_METHOD @TestInstance(Lifecycle.PER_METHOD)}
 * semantics, a non-static {@code @AutoClose} field will be closed after the
 * execution of each test method, test factory method, or test template method.
 * However, if the test class is configured with
 * {@link TestInstance.Lifecycle#PER_CLASS @TestInstance(Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)}
 * semantics, a non-static {@code @AutoClose} field will not be closed until the
 * current test class instance is no longer needed, which means after
 * {@code @AfterAll} methods and after all {@code static} {@code @AutoClose} fields
 * have been closed.
