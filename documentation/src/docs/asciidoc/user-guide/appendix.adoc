=== Reproducible Builds

Starting with version 5.7, JUnit 5 aims for its non-javadoc JARs to be
https://reproducible-builds.org/[reproducible].

Under identical build conditions, such as Java version, repeated builds should provide the
same output byte-for-byte.

This means that anyone can reproduce the build conditions of the artifacts on Maven
Central/Sonatype and produce the same output artifact locally, confirming that the
artifacts in the repositories were actually generated from this source code.

[[dependency-metadata]]
=== Dependency Metadata

Artifacts for final releases and milestones are deployed to {Maven_Central}, and snapshot
artifacts are deployed to Sonatype's {snapshot-repo}[snapshots repository] under
{snapshot-repo}/org/junit/[/org/junit].

[[dependency-metadata-junit-platform]]
==== JUnit Platform

* *Group ID*: `org.junit.platform`
* *Version*: `{platform-version}`
* *Artifact IDs*:
  `junit-platform-commons`::
    Common APIs and support utilities for the JUnit Platform. Any API annotated with
    `@API(status = INTERNAL)` is intended solely for usage within the JUnit framework
    itself. _Any usage of internal APIs by external parties is not supported!_
  `junit-platform-console`::
    Support for discovering and executing tests on the JUnit Platform from the console.
    See <<running-tests-console-launcher>> for details.
  `junit-platform-console-standalone`::
    An executable _Fat JAR_ that contains all dependencies is provided in Maven Central under the
    https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/junit/platform/junit-platform-console-standalone[junit-platform-console-standalone]
    directory. See <<running-tests-console-launcher>> for details.
  `junit-platform-engine`::
    Public API for test engines. See <<launcher-api-engines-custom>> for details.
  `junit-platform-jfr`::
    Provides a `LauncherDiscoveryListener` and `TestExecutionListener` for Java Flight
	Recorder events on the JUnit Platform. See <<running-tests-listeners-flight-recorder>>
	for details.
  `junit-platform-launcher`::
    Public API for configuring and launching test plans -- typically used by IDEs and
    build tools. See <<launcher-api>> for details.
  `junit-platform-reporting`::
    `TestExecutionListener` implementations that generate test reports -- typically used
    by IDEs and build tools. See <<junit-platform-reporting>> for details.
  `junit-platform-runner`::
    Runner for executing tests and test suites on the JUnit Platform in a JUnit 4
    environment. See <<running-tests-junit-platform-runner>> for details.
  `junit-platform-suite`::
    JUnit Platform Suite artifact that transitively pulls in dependencies on
    `junit-platform-suite-api` and `junit-platform-suite-engine` for simplified dependency
	management in build tools such as Gradle and Maven.
  `junit-platform-suite-api`::
    Annotations for configuring test suites on the JUnit Platform. Supported by the
    <<junit-platform-suite-engine, JUnit Platform Suite Engine>> and the
    <<running-tests-junit-platform-runner, JUnitPlatform runner>>.
  `junit-platform-suite-commons`::
    Common support utilities for executing test suites on the JUnit Platform.
  `junit-platform-suite-engine`::
    Engine that executes test suites on the JUnit Platform; only required at runtime. See
    <<junit-platform-suite-engine,JUnit Platform Suite Engine>> for details.
  `junit-platform-testkit`::
     Provides support for executing a test plan for a given `TestEngine` and then
     accessing the results via a fluent API to verify the expected results.

[[dependency-metadata-junit-jupiter]]
==== JUnit Jupiter

* *Group ID*: `org.junit.jupiter`
* *Version*: `{jupiter-version}`
* *Artifact IDs*:
  `junit-jupiter`::
    JUnit Jupiter aggregator artifact that transitively pulls in dependencies on
    `junit-jupiter-api`, `junit-jupiter-params`, and `junit-jupiter-engine` for
    simplified dependency management in build tools such as Gradle and Maven.
  `junit-jupiter-api`::
    JUnit Jupiter API for <<writing-tests,writing tests>> and <<extensions,extensions>>.
  `junit-jupiter-engine`::
    JUnit Jupiter test engine implementation; only required at runtime.
  `junit-jupiter-params`::
    Support for <<writing-tests-parameterized-tests,parameterized tests>> in JUnit Jupiter.
  `junit-jupiter-migrationsupport`::
    Support for migrating from JUnit 4 to JUnit Jupiter; only required for support for
    JUnit 4's `@Ignore` annotation and for running selected JUnit 4 rules.

[[dependency-metadata-junit-vintage]]
==== JUnit Vintage

* *Group ID*: `org.junit.vintage`
* *Version*: `{vintage-version}`
* *Artifact ID*:
  `junit-vintage-engine`::
    JUnit Vintage test engine implementation that allows one to run _vintage_ JUnit tests
    on the JUnit Platform. _Vintage_ tests include those written using JUnit 3 or JUnit 4
    APIs or tests written using testing frameworks built on those APIs.
